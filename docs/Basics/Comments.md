In order to avoid possible compilation problems, and to simplify the compilation process and improve the aesthetics and readability of the code, Carbon Script only support single-line comment.
Within a line, everything after the comment symbol will be ignored by the compiler.will not be compiled, interpreted or executed.

The comment line starts with character `#`, end up with line-end.

such as:
```
    # This is the comment line
``` 

If you require multiple lines of comments, you can add the `#` symbol in front of each line in the comment.
