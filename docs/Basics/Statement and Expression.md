## What's Expression

An expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies computation of a value,  or that designates an object or a function, or that generates side effects, or that performs a combination thereof. The value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator.

According to the application scenarios of expressions, they can be roughly divided into the following categories

+ calculation expression
+ logical expression
+ assignment expression
+ synthetic expression

## What's Statement

The composition of Statement and expression is consistent. But unlike an expression, no value is returned after a Statement is executed.
