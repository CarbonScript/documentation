### What's Carbland

Carbland is the only officially designated IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the CarbonScript language, which provides the basic functions of IDE, such as editing code, project management, code debugging and diagnosis, project construction, code analysis and other functions.

Carbland has a built-in CarbonScript compiler, which allows you to work with a graphical user interface without using command-line tools

Carbland is a cross-platform IDE based on `React` + `Electron` + `MonacoEditor` technology. It not only supports working on `Windows` systems, but also supports `Linux GUI` and `MacOS` platforms.

If you wish to work on Windows, please use Windows 7 or later version.

This project is currently in the development stage, for more work updates, please go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/carbonscript/carbland)
